## Abstract

Nunkiflow is a high-performance network traffic analysis tool designed for detecting and analyzing Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) implementations in TLS handshakes. Built in Rust for optimal performance and memory safety, it processes PCAP files to extract CICFlowMeter-compatible flow statistics while providing enhanced detection capabilities for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms including Kyber, ML-DSA, and hybrid schemes.

## Overview

The transition to Post-Quantum Cryptography represents a critical challenge for network security infrastructure. Nunkiflow addresses this challenge by providing researchers and security analysts with a comprehensive tool for:

- **PQC Detection**: Identifying quantum-resistant algorithms in TLS handshakes
- **Flow Analysis**: Generating CICFlowMeter-compatible network flow statistics
- **Protocol Analysis**: Detailed examination of TLS extensions and cipher suites
- **Performance Monitoring**: High-throughput processing of large-scale network captures

## Background and Motivation

### Post-Quantum Cryptography Transition

The advent of quantum computing poses significant threats to current cryptographic standards.

## Methodology

### Flow Detection Algorithm

The flow detection process follows these steps:

1. **Packet Parsing**: Extract IP and TCP headers from each packet
2. **Flow Key Generation**: Create unique flow identifiers based on 5-tuple
3. **Bidirectional Normalization**: Standardize flow direction for consistent analysis
4. **Timeout Management**: Implement configurable flow timeout mechanisms
5. **Statistics Aggregation**: Calculate comprehensive flow metrics

### PQC Detection Methodology

PQC algorithm detection employs a multi-layered approach:

1. **Cipher Suite Analysis**: Direct examination of negotiated cipher suites
2. **Extension Parsing**: Analysis of TLS extensions for PQC support
3. **Certificate Analysis**: Examination of certificate signature algorithms
4. **Hybrid Scheme Detection**: Identification of classical-quantum hybrid implementations

### Statistical Validation

The tool implements comprehensive validation mechanisms:

- **Mean Packet Length Verification**: Cross-validation of calculated statistics
- **Flow Duration Consistency**: Temporal analysis of flow boundaries
- **Packet Size Validation**: Verification against standard MTU constraints
- **Protocol Consistency**: Validation of TLS field coherence
